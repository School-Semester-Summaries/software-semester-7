# Software Advanced (S7)
I didn't pass. What went wrong.

- I missed a lot of cruscial information at the start of the semster ecspecially on the group project. This resulted in me not being able to contribute a lot on the group project.
- I broke my hand which made me miss 3 weeks of doing anything.
- Everyone in my group project was so advanced which was very demotivating.
- My individual project never really had a clear structure and architecture.
- My research was cool, but didn't really contribute to my IP or GP.
- After my terrible internship, and two semesters of AI and python I kinda lost the flow of solving coding/IT problems. everything in my past 3 semester was so easy and fun. It took me a while to transition back to the good old flow.
- I didn't try enough. I was never really in the mood to work on school, bad sleeping schedule, bad eating schedule, always tired.


As if right now, I just restarted my semester 7. I am in the first week and everything went better than last semester, let's hope i can keep it going.
